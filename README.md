# Technical assignment for Property Jungle

* Recreate homepage design in HMTL & CSS
* Use Bootstrap for responsiveness to build mobile-first layout that scales across devices
* Build in JQuery, if possible

## Approach

* Studied design visual and considered how to break down layout into navigational sections divided into rows and columns
* Populated index file with all necessary (unstyled) context (i.e. text and images)
* Took a top down approach to work from header to footer

## Review

* Though I had a basic understanding of how Bootstrap can be used, I haven't fully put it to work before. Likewise, I haven't yet had such an indepth experience of trying to redevelop a design with mobile in mind. For the purposes of this exercise I wanted to push myself by learning to implement Bootstrap grid to produce elements that collapse for mobile. There is some responsive functionality in place, but more work is required to create more sophisticated positioning of elements, as presented in the mock-up. 

## Aspects to be resolved

* Strapline and blurb in header section should be bottom-left aligned to the viewport
* Nav items should ideally be in nav-bar button on mobile view, with phone number and search facility moving under the logo
* Main section yellow text box to float bottom-right over central image (with central image aligning left)
* Quote block text to be aligned left
* Main section images to displayed uniformly at full screen with consistent spacing between elements; this section should also float over the contact section
* Social SVG files to be recoloured white; tried this on Illustrator but resulted in strange behaviour when displaying updated files
* Add mouse-over effect for socials to change colour of the icons
* Footer text and logos to be bottom-aligned with logo and adddress column
* Property Ombudsman logo would not load

## Achievements

* Learning how to apply the gradient effect to the background image in the header
